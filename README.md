## About Me

At **Structured**, weâ€™re building a semantic layer designed to eliminate metric inconsistency across organizations. Data fragmentation is a core issue that leads to broken decision-making and lost time. Our solution integrates directly with your **cloud data warehouse** (Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.), enforcing a **single source of truth** for business-critical metrics like CAC, MRR, and LTV. By defining metrics centrally, we ensure consistency across all analytics tools, dashboards, and teams.

My focus is on **data modeling** and developing robust frameworks that allow businesses to query and aggregate metrics without worrying about discrepancies or manual reconciliation. This involves creating a **semantic layer** on top of existing data models, abstracting complexity, and providing a well-defined, queryable metrics repository.

## Engineering Journey

At **Meta**, I led the development of a **knowledge base system** used to improve the effectiveness of machine learning classifiers in **Trust and Safety** (Integrity). My work was primarily focused on building scalable systems for weak labeling, leveraging subject matter expertise to bootstrap new classifiers for harmful content detection.

Before Meta, I was an intern at **Google** and **Microsoft** on distributed systems like **Borg** and **HyperV**. These experiences have honed my skills in scaling infrastructure and building reliable, mission-critical software. 

The problem of **data integrity** and **semantic consistency** is what drives my current work at Structured.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, JavaScript
- **Data Tools**: dbt, Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres
- **Focus Areas**: Data Modeling, Metrics Consistency, Distributed Systems, Semantic Layers

Iâ€™m currently deep in the architecture of **semantic layers** that allow for flexible, reliable metric computation. By abstracting the underlying data models, we make querying business metrics intuitive and error-free across various analytics platforms.
